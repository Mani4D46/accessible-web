# A plea from Iran
I'm reaching out from a country where the government heavily restricts internet access. I'm speaking out on behalf of the people who are being unfairly blocked from accessing the web.

If you have a website, I urge you to help us break down these barriers. If you use security services like Cloudflare, please refrain from enabling blocks that target Iran or Russia. The reality is, attacks are more likely to come from other countries that aren't blocked.

By blocking us, you're not protecting yourself from the government; you're hurting innocent people. We're not the ones attacking your website - we're just trying to access information and connect with the world.

Access to the internet is a fundamental human right, and it's essential for us to access knowledge and stay informed. Unfortunately, the Iranian government has restricted access to many popular websites like YouTube, Twitter, Google Play, Discord, and more. Even worse, many websites like Google Workspaces, Google Docs, and even character.ai are blocking us, too.

### Please help us by keeping your website accessible to everyone, regardless of their location. Together, we can promote freedom of information and support the people who need it most.

Thank you for reading it all :pray:. again please help me spread the word.
